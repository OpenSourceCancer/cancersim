We want to simulate cancer cells in the epidermis and dermis

4 types of cells:
    epidermal, cancer, boundary, dermal
    
They have links between them.

Forces are springs with a short range interaction



Have an array of all of the cell positions
have a list of cell types
have a dictionary of lists for the neighbor-list


use ODEINT for the integration
and scipy.spatial.Delanay for the initialization.


NEW VERSION
	TODO:
		impliment cells and positions
		store links.
